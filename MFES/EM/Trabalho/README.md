# Paxos Distributed Algorithm

Trabalho Prático - Especificação e Modelação

## Consensus
A specification of the consensus problem.

## Voting
A specification of a very abstract consensus algorithm with a high level (unchecked) TLA+ proof that it implements the Consensus spec.

## Paxos
A specification of a high-level version of the Paxos algorithm, a distributed message-passing algorithm that implements the Voting spec and hence implements consensus.

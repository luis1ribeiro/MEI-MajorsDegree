## Software Architecture and Calculi
### Design and Analysis of a cyber-physical system

This folder contains works developed in the course of MFES: Software Architecture and Calculi. The course provides a perspective on process algebra (architecture & calculi).

The [first work](https://github.com/luis1ribeiro/MEI-MajorsDegree/tree/main/MFES/AC/Trabalhos/TP1) focus on modeling and analysis of a cyber-physical system based on the *UPPAAL* tool. In this, the intended purpose is to design and analyse a system that ensures the correct functioning of traffic lights, where reasoning about behavioura assumptions are necessary.

The [second work](https://github.com/luis1ribeiro/MEI-MajorsDegree/tree/main/MFES/AC/Trabalhos/TP2) focus on modeling and analysis of a cyber-physical system using Monads. This assignment revolves around the travelling salesman problem (TSP). This is a famous example of a question that can be easily formulated but whose answer cannot be efficiently obtained.
